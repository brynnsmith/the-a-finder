<h2>How It's Made</h2>

The A Finder's design was conceptualized in Figma with a basic wireframe and colour palette. Then we set out sourcing realiable, helpful information under each category to flesh out the content. The site was built with a mobile-first approach as msot users will be discovering the site via mobile. For this reason, it was extremely important to ensure that the website elements were accessible and that the site had a fast load time. This was achieved using accessibility best practices such as design with high colour contrast, alt text on images, and clear layout structuring. The load time was kept low through minimal graphic use, optimized images and dry code.

<b>Tech Used:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

If I had more time for this project, I would have liked to add translations in multiple languages so more people could easily access the content. I would also add smooth transitions for page jumps and smooth scrolling to enhance the user experience.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

The main challenge of this project was delivering a product that was both visually minimal as well as engaging. The experience was expected to feel comfortable and welcoming for the user, so colour and graphic art style were very important. The menu was to have the same aesthetic, so I carried the colour palette over and added a smooth transition upon toggling the sandwich icon.
